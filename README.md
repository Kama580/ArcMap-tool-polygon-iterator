# ArcMap-tool-polygon-iterator

This is an ArcMap tool for duplicating polygon layers, while changing their height value so they can be displayed on top of each other in a 3D display.

This can be extremely helpful for building modeling. if you have a layer with a polygon in the shape of a building, run this to add floors for 3D display. The layer will be added with more polygons of the same shape and location, but with different vertical values.

Run the add columns tool first on your layer to make sure you have the correct fields.

When running the parcel iterator, you can define what the gap between each layer would be and what the height of each layer should be.
